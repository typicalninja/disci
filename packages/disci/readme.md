An user-friendly library for handling Discord interactions via interaction webhooks, suitable for both Node.js and Cloudflare Workers, (with **untested** support for additional platforms).

## 🚀 Install

Use any of the following commands

```bash
npm install disci

# yarn

yarn add disci

# pnpm

pnpm add disci

```

## Overview

DisciJs Introduces multiple helpers and classes to make easier when handling interactions via the new (relatively) interaction webhook system.



> DisciJs does not include a native way to verify discord interactions. You can use [discord-interactions-js](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-js) or [discord-verify](https://github.com/IanMitchell/interaction-kit/tree/main/packages/discord-verify) for validation of received requests

This package expects you to have **prior knowledge of javascript / typescript** and **prior knowledge with interacting with the discord api** via either,

1. The raw api
2. or other discord libraries (like discord.js)
